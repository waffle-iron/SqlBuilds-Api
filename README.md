I'm going to use [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/kchenery/SqlBuilds-Api) to track issues. So head over there to raise any new ones you have found.

In the future I may post the source code to the website here to allow pull requests.  "May" being the operative word here - I did this site as a way to learn WebApi in .Net

If you are wanting to know how to use sqlbuilds.azurewebsites.net have a look at the [swagger documentation](http://sqlbuilds.azurewebsites.net/swagger)
