Hi. Feel free to log issues with the sqlbuilds.azurewebsite.net api.  Please check if there is an existing issue raised before creating a new one.

In the future I may post the source code to the website here to allow pull requests.  "May" being the operative word here - I did this site as a way to learn WebApi in .Net

If you are wanting to know how to use sqlbuilds.azurewebsites.net have a look at the [swagger documentation](http://sqlbuilds.azurewebsites.net/swagger)
